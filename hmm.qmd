## Intro

Today's class is about using hidden Markov models (HMMs) to infer an animal's behavioral state from its movement track. HMMs are *statistical* models with broad applications, well beyond ecology ([@fig-hmm]).

![Hidden Markov models are statistical models that infer hidden states (e.g., behavior) from a sequence of observations (e.g., step lengths and turning angles).](images/hmm.png){#fig-hmm}

We will use HMMs in the context of movement ecology, which is a *scientific* model ([@fig-movement-ecology]).

![The movement ecology framework is a scientific model describing how animals interact with their environments through movement.](images/movementecology.png){#fig-movement-ecology}

Our goals for today are to:

-   *Relate* components of intuitive, scientific, statistical, and computational models.

-   *Implement* a hidden Markov model using quantitative movement metrics.

-   *Interpret* components of the statistical model in the context of the scientific model.

Picture the moment one of our seabirds (Cooper, Ella, or Sydney) slowed down from a sprint to a walk and bent down to look for a fishing lure.

**Q1:** Describe how you think this moment would be described by intuitive, scientific, and statistical models.

int. - we saw them physically saw them slow down and begin to turn

sci. - externally see an eddy and internally they begin to slow and change states

stat. - their step lengths begin to decrease in size as their turn angles increase in frequency

## Setup

Run `install.packages("moveHMM")` at the console.

```{r}
#| label: setup

library(moveHMM)
library(terra)
library(tidyverse)
library(tidyterra)
theme_set(theme_bw())

```

## Load data

We will use two data sources in today's class: the movement track (data/track.gpx) and an environmental raster describing the frontal features (data/frontal_intensity.tiff).

```{r}
#| label: load-data

# Load track
track_gpx <- vect("data/track.gpx", layer = "track_points")

# Convert to data frame (necessary for HMM)
track <- tibble(
  lon = geom(track_gpx)[, "x"],
  lat = geom(track_gpx)[, "y"]
)

# Load environment
frontal_intensity <- rast("data/frontal_intensity.tiff")

```

Visualize the two data sources together.

```{r}
#| label: viz-data

# Convert track points to lines
track_lines <- as.lines(track_gpx)

# Create map
ggplot() +
  geom_spatraster(data = frontal_intensity) +
  geom_spatvector(data = track_lines) +
  scale_fill_distiller(palette = "RdYlBu")

```

## Fit the statistical model

Now we'll fit a hidden Markov model to our data.

-   Note: Clarify what the #\| means

```{r}
#| label: prepare-data

# Prepare the data for model fitting
track_prep <- prepData(track, coordNames = c("lon", "lat"))

```

**Q2:** What did `prepData()` do? What does this mean in the context of the scientific and statistical models?

```{r}
#| label: viz-metrics

# Visualize distribution of step lengths
ggplot(track_prep, aes(step)) +
  geom_histogram()

# Visualize distribution of turning angles
ggplot(track_prep, aes(angle)) +
  geom_histogram()

```

**Q3:** What are reasonable *starting parameters* for the forage and transit states? Recall the track simulation from week 4.

| Parameter           | Forage | Transit |
|---------------------|--------|---------|
| Step mean           | 0.001  | 0.005   |
| Step s.d.           | 0.001  | 0.002   |
| Angle mean          | 0      | 0       |
| Angle concentration | 1      | 5       |

```{r}
#| label: fit-hmm

# Fit a 2-state HMM to the track
track_hmm <- fitHMM(track_prep,
                    nbStates = 2,
                    stepPar0 = c(0.001, 0.005, 0.001, 0.002),
                    anglePar0 = c(0, 0, 1, 5))

```

```{r}
#| label: viz-hmm

# Visualize the components of the HMM
plot(track_hmm, ask = FALSE)

```

**Q4:** Match each plot to one of the components of the HMM. Note: one component is represented twice, one plot shows two components, and one component isn't plotted.

## Refine the statistical model

Our model currently infers behavior in a vacuum. Even though the classification of foraging and transit appears reasonable, we have no other context to interpret the behavior. Though our model may be accurate, it's not adding much to our understanding of the scientific model. Let's incorporate the frontal intensity data into the model to gain a deeper understanding of our seabirds' movement ecology.

**Q6:** Using the *since-if-then* framing, write a hypothesis for the relationship between seabird behavior and frontal intensity.

Mine: Since seabirds traverse vast amounts of weather patterns, if fish tend to congregate around weather structures, then we can assume that they forage more often at these fronts.

Max: Since prey aggregate at mesoscale features, if seabirds get close to these features then seabirds are more likely to start foraging.

```{r}
#| label: refine-model

# First, extract the frontal intensity at the track locations
track_front <- terra::extract(frontal_intensity, track_gpx)
track_prep$frontal_intensity <- track_front[, 2]

# Fit model, incorporating the frontal intensity
track_hmm2 <- fitHMM(track_prep,
                    nbStates = 2,
                    formula = ~ frontal_intensity,
                    stepPar0 = c(0.001, 0.005, 0.001, 0.002),
                    anglePar0 = c(0, 0, 1, 5))

```

Visualize the refined model.

```{r}
#| label: viz-hmm2

# Plot refined HMM
plot(track_hmm2, ask = FALSE)

```

**Q7:** What new component did we plot?

We plotted the transition "matrix" which appears in the third figure

**Q8:** Interpret the new component in the context of the scientific and statistical models.

The closer to a front that a seabird gets the more probable it is to begin foraging.

## Reflect

**Q9:** *"All models are wrong, but some are useful."* What is one way this statistical model is "wrong" (i.e., omits or simplifies part of the scientific model) and one way that it is useful (i.e., adds to our understanding of the scientific model).

The statistical model is "wrong" in the fact that it emits the internal functions that occur to create these outcomes for the bird. We are looking more specifically at the external factors with these figures, but that does not account for all the information at play.

The statistical model is proven to be helpful in our understanding of the behaviors of the seabirds because it lays out a statistical method for which a seabird act in the presence of a front and eddy.
